	<section class="dataOne">
		<h2>Medals Won Per Sport By Canada</h2>
		<p>Below are two graphs depicting the amalgamated medal count won by Canadian atheletes in the Winter Olympics between 1846-2014 in each sport. Each Graph represents the same data, simply displayed differently. It becomes clear fairly quickly which sports Canada excels at. Unsuprisingly, the sport with the greatest medal count is Hockey. Which truly does reinforce some stereotypes of Canadians(to no ones harm). When displaying this information, our bar graph on the left seems much more effective at quuickly demonstrating the vast differences between the winning medal counts of each sport. The scatter plot to the right does an acceptable job, but, fails to communicate the weight og Canadians Hockey glory.</p>
