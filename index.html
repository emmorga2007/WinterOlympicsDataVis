		<h2>Medals Won Per Sport By Canadians</h2>
		<p>Below are two graphs depicting the amalgamated medal count won by Canadian atheletes in the Winter Olympics between 1846-2014 in each sport. Each Graph represents the same data, simply displayed differently. It becomes clear fairly quickly which sports Canada excels at. Unsuprisingly, the sport with the greatest medal count is Hockey. Which truly does reinforce some stereotypes of Canadians(to no ones harm). When displaying this information, our bar graph on the left seems much more effective at quuickly demonstrating the vast differences between the winning medal counts of each sport. The scatter plot to the right does an acceptable job, but, fails to communicate the weight og Canadians Hockey glory.</p>

		<h2> Overall Medal Count For Hockey v.s Skating </h2>
		<p> Selected here are the two winter olympic sports in which Canada has won the highest overall medal count - Ice Hockey and Ice Skating. Perhaps this is due to our countries readily avaliable icy surfaces nearly 6 months of the year and winter bordem. The graphs show the individual medal counts - bronze, silver and gold - achieved by Candian atheletes in these two sports from 1846-2014. These Graphs help to demonstrate the leading achivements won by Canadian Hockey players.Seen below, the bronze and silver counts are nearly similar. Glancing to the gold column, however, shows a drastic difference. For Ice Skating, just under 40 gold medals were won. Where as Ice Hockey has won upwards of 200 gold medals. Amazing! </p>

		<h2> Hockey v.s Skating Gold Counts</h2>
		<p> Clearly illustrated below is Canadians excelling abilties on the ice. In both sports Canadians have collected a higher then average count of medals. However, when asked the question, what sport do Canadians excell at? the uncontested answer would be Hockey. Congratulations to all the men and women who have contributed to this great sport and to Canadas renowed excellence in the winter olympics. May we continue to kick butt and may every kid lose at least one baby tooth to "the good 'ole hockey game". Cheers!</p>
