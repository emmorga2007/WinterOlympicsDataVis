Hello! 
The following document contains data that has been sampled form the IOC Research and Reference Service and Published by The Gaurdian's Datablog in reference to Olympic Medals and Sports from 1896-2014. In this document, I have analyzed What sports Canada excels at by looking at the top two sports canada has the highest overall medal count. Of these two, I had analyzed the amount won of each medal - bronze, silver and gold. Using this infomration I decided to look at the overall gold count achieve in each sport. Thus determining which winter olympic sport canada excelles at. Which, is the sport where atheletes have not only won a great number of medals, but also where - of those medals won - they have collected a high count of gold medals.
