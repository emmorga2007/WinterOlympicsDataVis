Hello! 
The following document contains data that has been sampled form the IOC Research and Reference Service and Published by The Gaurdian's Datablog in reference to Olympic Medals and Sports from 1896-2014. In this document, I have analyzed What sports Canada excels at by looking at the top two sports canada has the highest overall medal count. Of these two, I had analyzed the amount won of each medal - bronze, silver and gold. Using this infomration I decided to look at the overall gold count achieve in each sport. Thus determining which winter olympic sport canada excelles at. Which, is the sport where atheletes have not only won a great number of medals, but also where - of those medals won - they have collected a high count of gold medals.

Regarding the Data Files
Problem:
>>> unfortunately I coud not run Python3 through my data/charts.py file from gitbash. It claimed I was unauthorized, so screw it. 
Solution:
>>>Instead, after researching throughout google, I plugged the data directly into the Python3 command window to create the matplotlib charts. A 3.5 hour long process from learning how to install matplotlib to actually using it to generate some very rough looking graphs...
Enjoy!
Outcome: 
>>>The data/... files are examples of the variables used in python to generate the charts.
